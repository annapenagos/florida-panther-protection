      A few ways in which you can help to keep Florida's Panthers from going
      extinct are:
    </h2>

    <p class="intro-p text-container-p">
      The Florida Panther was placed on the extinction list in 1967 with an
      estimated low of 10 panthers. Since they were placed on that list and a
      habitat conservation plan was put in place in 1994 there has been an
      increase to an estimated 200 panthers though they remain on the endangered
      species list and placed on a 5-year review according to the Endangered
      Species Act of 1973.

      Resource 1: "Does Hunting Activity for Game Species Have Indirect Effects
      on Resource Selection by the Endangered Florida Panther?" Key Takeaways:
      Hunting fair game still has an impact on other species that rely on those
      species in their diet. Therefore there is something to be said about the
      extent that we allow fair game to be hunted, because after a certain point
      it still circles back to impacting the endangered Florida Panthers
    </h2>

    <p class="intro-p text-container-p">
      “Hunting activities can affect game species in several ways; however,
      indirect effects of hunting on non-game species have received less
      attention than direct effects on game species, even though such potential
      effects could be crucial in some situations. There is ongoing concern that
      the critically endangered Florida panther Puma concolor coryi may be
      influenced by hunting activity, in terms of changes in panther resource
      selection and distribution.” (McCarthy)
